# First of all, I want to explain the environment for Python development, 
# which will be intended for anyone who don't want to use any install in local computer

## Access to colab.google.com/notebooks
## it will make you to use on this cloud platform

## notebook of google colab is supposed to be virtual system for python
## so for convenient we will mount that with your google drive to upload/download between the virtual system and your google drive.

## step 2
import os
if not os.path.exists('/content/gdrive'):
  drive.mount('/content/gdrive')

## step 3
cd /content/gdrive/'My Drive'

## step 4
if not os.path.exists('Python_Manual'):
  !git clone https://github.com/swgu931/Python_Manual.git
